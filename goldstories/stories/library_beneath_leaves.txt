The Library Beneath the Leaves
Ani

At the far end of the forest, hidden beneath the tangled branches of a giant oak, there was a place known only to a few: The Library Beneath the Leaves. It wasn’t like the libraries in town, with grand shelves and heavy books. This library was quiet and alive, tucked into the forest floor, where stories waited to be found like fallen leaves.
The library had no doors, only a curtain of ivy that swayed gently in the breeze. And there was no librarian to keep things in order—only a soft wind that stirred the leaves now and then, mixing them into new piles. It was said that if you looked carefully, you could find stories written on the leaves—short, simple tales, carried by the forest wind from faraway places.
The animals of the forest often visited the library. Rabbits curled up with tales of adventures in meadows, and owls perched among the branches, reading poems written by moonlight. But there was one visitor unlike any other—Carlo, a boy from the nearby village.

One autumn afternoon, as Carlo wandered through the forest, he stumbled upon the curtain of ivy, parting gently with the breeze. Curious, he pushed the leaves aside and stepped through—into a world that felt like the space between dreams and waking.
The forest floor was soft beneath his feet, and everywhere he looked, there were leaves of every color—gold, crimson, and copper—each one etched with tiny words. Some leaves carried poems; others, letters or little stories told in just a few lines.
Carlo picked up a golden leaf and read aloud:"Once, a squirrel fell in love with the sound of the rain."
He smiled. It was such a small story, but it filled his heart with warmth, like hearing a secret only the forest knew.

Carlo sat beneath the oak tree, letting the leaves scatter around him. He read stories about midnight trains that never stopped, mice who painted pictures inside walnuts, and a storm that forgot how to rain. Each one was different, yet each felt like it belonged right where it was, as if the wind had placed it there on purpose.
But after reading story after story, Carlo realized that none of the leaves held the thing he was looking for—not exactly. What Carlo really wanted was a story that felt like his own, something that spoke to the quiet, wandering feeling inside him, the one he didn’t quite understand.
He sighed, running his fingers through the piles of leaves. “Maybe my story isn’t here after all,” he whispered.
Just then, the wind stirred, lifting the leaves into the air. They swirled gently around him, like a soft breath from the forest, and a single, bright-green leaf fluttered down into his lap.

Carlo picked up the leaf. Unlike the others, this one was blank. There were no words, no tiny letters written along the veins—just a smooth, empty surface waiting for something to appear.
Carlo turned it over in his hands. “What does this mean?” he wondered aloud.
A voice drifted softly through the wind, as if carried from the heart of the forest itself:"Some stories aren’t found, little one—they are made."
Carlo’s heart gave a small flutter. Slowly, he took a tiny piece of charcoal from his pocket, the same one he always used to doodle on bits of paper back home. With the leaf resting on his knee, he began to draw.
He sketched the winding paths he’d wandered that morning, the way the sunlight had trickled through the branches, and the little acorn he had found in his pocket. It wasn’t a grand story, but it was his story—and as he drew, it felt like the forest was listening, waiting quietly for each new line to appear.

When he finished, Carlo held up the leaf, smiling at his little drawing. It wasn’t much—a moment in time, captured in a few simple lines. But somehow, it felt enough.
He placed the leaf gently among the others on the forest floor, adding his story to the library. The leaves rustled softly, as if thanking him, and the wind swirled through the trees, carrying the new story deeper into the forest, where it would drift and settle, waiting for the next curious visitor to find it.
Carlo stood, brushing off his hands. The forest felt a little different now, not because anything had changed, but because he knew he belonged to the stories—not just the ones he read, but the ones he lived and created along the way.
With a light heart, Carlo stepped back through the ivy curtain, knowing that the Library Beneath the Leaves would always be there—a place where stories came and went, just like seasons, just like the wind.
And as he walked home, the leaves whispered behind him, carrying his story with them, out into the world.

The End.
