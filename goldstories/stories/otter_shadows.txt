The Otter Who Collected Shadows
Ani

In a quiet bend of the river, where the water gleamed like glass and the reeds whispered in the breeze, lived an otter named Niko. But Niko wasn’t like the other otters, who spent their days swimming and sliding down muddy banks. Niko had a peculiar hobby—he loved to collect shadows.
Most animals didn’t think much about shadows. They stretched long in the evening and shrank away at noon, always changing with the light. But Niko found them fascinating. He liked the way shadows danced on the riverbank, hiding one moment and reappearing the next. He loved the idea that even ordinary things—like a leaf or a pebble—could have shadows of their own.
So, every day, while the other otters played, Niko went searching for shadows. He carried a little satchel made of leaves and twine, where he carefully tucked away the most interesting ones he found—shadows of fish darting beneath the water, the silhouette of a dragonfly resting on a reed, even the curving shadow of a snail shell.
But Niko had one wish he hadn’t yet fulfilled. “If only,” he sighed one afternoon, “I could find the perfect shadow—something no otter has ever seen.”

One evening, as the sky turned pink and gold, Niko spotted something unusual along the riverbank. A shadow twisted and swirled beneath the surface of the water, as though it didn’t belong to any fish or rock. It shifted and shimmered, changing shape with the ripples in the water.
“That’s it!” Niko whispered excitedly. “That’s the most beautiful shadow I’ve ever seen!”
Without thinking, he dove into the water, chasing the swirling shadow. It darted away like a playful fish, and Niko swam after it, deeper and deeper into the cool, clear river. Just when he thought he had it within reach, the shadow slipped between the roots of a willow tree growing near the water’s edge.
Disappointed but determined, Niko poked his nose between the roots—and found himself staring at the smallest animal he’d ever seen. It was a tiny frog with glimmering skin, no bigger than a pebble.
“Oh!” Niko gasped, “I thought you were a shadow!”
The little frog gave a tiny croak, tilting its head curiously. “A shadow? I suppose I do look a bit like one, don’t I? My name is Fern, by the way.”
Niko blinked. “I’ve never seen a frog like you before.”
Fern chuckled softly. “That’s because I’m not an ordinary frog. I belong to the Evening Pool, where twilight never ends.”
“The Evening Pool?” Niko echoed, intrigued. “What’s that?”
Fern smiled mysteriously. “It’s a hidden place where shadows live even after the light is gone. If you follow me, I’ll show you.”

Curiosity bubbling inside him, Niko swam after Fern, weaving through the willow roots until the water around them darkened. A soft, silvery mist floated above the surface, and the river seemed to stretch farther than it ever had before.
When they emerged, Niko gasped in wonder. They had entered a magical part of the river, where everything glowed faintly, as if kissed by moonlight. The surface of the water was dotted with lily pads, and everywhere he looked, shadows danced—some curled like ribbons, others leaped like playful fish, and a few swayed gently, as if moved by an invisible breeze.
“This,” said Fern proudly, “is the Evening Pool. It’s where shadows come to rest when the world turns dark.”
Niko watched in awe as a butterfly’s shadow fluttered across the water, followed by the shadow of a falling leaf that drifted gently down, even though there was no leaf in sight.
“This is perfect!” Niko whispered, his heart full of joy. “The most beautiful shadows I’ve ever seen! But... how do I take one with me?”
Fern smiled kindly. “You can’t, Niko. Shadows belong to the moments they come from. They’re not meant to be collected—they’re meant to be noticed.”

Niko felt a little pang of sadness. “So, I can’t keep any of these shadows?”
Fern shook his tiny head. “No, but that’s the magic of it. Shadows are always changing, just like moments. If you try to hold on too tightly, you’ll miss all the new ones waiting to be discovered.”
Niko sat quietly for a moment, watching the shadows drift across the water. He thought about all the shadows he had collected in his satchel—the dragonfly, the snail shell, the fish—and how he had wanted to keep them forever.
“You’re right,” Niko said softly. “I think I understand now.”
Fern gave a tiny, approving croak. “Good. Come, I’ll take you back to your part of the river. There are plenty of shadows waiting for you there.”

Fern led Niko back through the willow roots, and soon they emerged once more into the familiar waters of the river. The stars were beginning to appear, twinkling faintly above the treetops.
“Thank you, Fern,” Niko said, giving the little frog a warm smile. “I’ll remember what you taught me.”
Fern gave a cheerful wave. “Farewell, shadow-chaser! Enjoy the new ones you find.”
As Fern disappeared beneath the water, Niko climbed onto the riverbank, his satchel still resting by his side. He opened it slowly and smiled at the shadows he had collected—not because he wanted to keep them, but because they reminded him of the moments he had noticed.
From that night on, Niko no longer worried about finding the perfect shadow. Instead, he let himself enjoy the ones that appeared around him every day—the long shadow of the reeds at sunset, the soft outline of a bird flying overhead, and the playful splash of his own shadow dancing on the water.
He had learned that some things weren’t meant to be kept—they were meant to be noticed, cherished, and let go.
And as he floated on his back, watching the stars shimmer above, Niko felt lighter than he ever had before. The river whispered gently, the world full of new moments waiting to be discovered, and Niko knew that wherever the shadows drifted, he would be ready to follow.

The End.
