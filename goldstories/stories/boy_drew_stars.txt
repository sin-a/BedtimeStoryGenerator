The Boy Who Drew the Stars
Adv

In a small seaside village, where the waves whispered against the shore and the wind carried the scent of salt and pine, lived a boy named Leo. Leo wasn’t like the other children, who spent their days running on the beach or building sandcastles. He liked to sit quietly in his little house at the top of the hill, filling the pages of his sketchbook with stars.
Leo loved the stars more than anything. Every night, as the village slept, he would climb up to his favorite spot — a rocky cliff that overlooked the ocean — and draw the constellations he saw above. He never tired of the way they shimmered, distant and untouchable, scattered like tiny treasures across the night sky.
But there was one thing that made Leo sad. The stars seemed so far away — so high above the earth, beyond the reach of anyone. No matter how many he sketched or how perfectly he captured their shapes, he couldn’t help but wish that just once, he could bring the stars closer.

One afternoon, as Leo sat at his usual spot by the cliffs, a girl named Nora wandered over. Nora was the kind of person who always seemed to carry a bit of sunshine in her pocket, even on rainy days. She had freckles on her nose and wind-tangled hair, and she was always curious about the things Leo drew.
“What are you working on today?” Nora asked, plopping down beside him.
Leo flipped through the pages of his sketchbook, showing her his drawings — big constellations shaped like lions and eagles, tiny stars drawn with careful dots. “It’s the stars,” he said quietly. “I like drawing them. But… they feel so far away.”
Nora rested her chin in her hands, thinking for a moment. “What if,” she said with a grin, “we make them feel closer?”
Leo blinked. “How?”
Nora stood up, brushing sand from her shorts. “Come on! We’ll find a way.”
Leo wasn’t sure what she meant, but he liked the way Nora’s ideas always felt a little like adventures, so he followed her down the hill.

Together, Leo and Nora searched the village for things that sparkled and glowed. They gathered seashells that shimmered like pearls, pieces of broken glass from the beach that the ocean had polished smooth, and strings of tiny lanterns from the village market.
“We’ll make our own stars,” Nora said. “Ones we can touch.”
That evening, they climbed back up to the cliff with their treasures. As the sun dipped below the horizon, Leo and Nora began to hang the lanterns on the branches of the pine trees that lined the cliffs. They tucked the glowing seashells into the rocks and scattered the glass pieces on the ground, where they caught the light of the setting sun and sparkled like distant stars.
By the time the sky grew dark, their little patch of the world looked like a constellation come to life. The lanterns swayed in the breeze, glowing softly, and the shells and glass sparkled beneath their feet.
Leo stood back, gazing at the scene with wide eyes. For the first time, it felt like the stars had come down to earth, filling the night with their quiet magic.
Nora nudged him gently. “See? Now the stars aren’t so far away.”
Leo smiled, his heart light. “It’s perfect.”

The two friends lay back on the cool grass, watching their homemade stars sway and twinkle above them. The real stars glimmered far beyond, but tonight, they didn’t feel quite so distant.
“This is better than any drawing,” Leo whispered, hugging his sketchbook close.
Nora grinned. “That’s because you made it real.”
For a long time, they lay in comfortable silence, listening to the waves and the rustle of the wind through the trees. The night felt full of possibility, as if the whole world was waiting just beyond the horizon, ready for whatever they might dream next.

Before they left the cliff, Nora reached down and picked up a small piece of glass that sparkled like a star. She placed it gently in Leo’s hand. “Here,” she said. “Now you can keep a little piece of tonight with you. For whenever the stars feel too far away again.”
Leo turned the glass over in his fingers, the edges smooth and cool. It wasn’t much — a tiny, glimmering piece of an ordinary thing — but it felt like a piece of something important.
“Thanks, Nora,” he said quietly.
Nora gave him a playful nudge. “And if the stars ever feel far again, we’ll come back and make more.”
Leo smiled, tucking the little glass star into the pocket of his sketchbook. “Deal.”

From that night on, Leo no longer worried about the stars being too far away. Whenever he felt small beneath the vast sky, he would open his sketchbook, touch the little piece of glass Nora had given him, and remember that some stars are close enough to hold — especially the ones made with a friend.
And whenever the sky was clear and the night felt just right, he and Nora would climb back up to the cliffs, hang their lanterns in the trees, and fill the night with stars they could touch.
Because sometimes, all it takes to bring the stars a little closer is a good idea, a handful of glowing things, and a friend who believes in your dreams.

The End.
