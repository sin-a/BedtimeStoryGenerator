The River of Stars
Mag

In a quiet village, tucked beneath rolling hills, there was a river that sparkled under the night sky, as if someone had poured starlight into the water. It was called the River of Stars, and though everyone admired its beauty, no one knew where it began. Some said it came from a distant mountain where the moon dipped low to kiss the earth. Others said the stars themselves wept into the river, filling it with their light.
But no one ever followed the river to find out—until Dotty decided she would.

Dotty was a dreamer. She spent her nights lying by the riverbank, watching the stars dance on the water’s surface, and wondered what it would be like to follow the river to its source. One evening, as the first fireflies blinked awake, she made up her mind. She would discover where the River of Stars began, no matter how far it took her.
She packed a lantern and a blanket and slipped quietly out of her house as the moon rose high. The river shimmered beside her, reflecting the sky’s silver glow. With a deep breath, Dotty followed the sparkling water, her heart light with excitement.
As she walked deeper into the night, strange things began to appear along the riverbanks. Silver fish leapt from the water, their scales shining like tiny moons. Glowing lilies bobbed on the surface, and every now and then, a gentle ripple would carry a soft, musical hum through the air, as if the river were singing an ancient lullaby.
Dotty followed the river through meadows and forests, the stars guiding her way. After a time, she reached a place where the river narrowed and shimmered even brighter. A fox with fur the color of twilight sat by the edge, dipping its paw into the water. When it saw Dotty, the fox’s golden eyes gleamed.

“Are you lost, little one?” the fox asked in a voice that sounded like a breeze stirring autumn leaves.
“No,” Dotty answered with a small smile. “I’m following the river to find out where it begins.”
The fox twitched its ears thoughtfully. “The journey won’t be easy,” it said. “Not everyone can find the river’s source. Some lose their way, and others turn back before they reach it.”
“I won’t turn back,” Dotty said, her heart steady. “I want to see where the stars meet the water.”
The fox gave a curious look, then stood up gracefully. “In that case, follow me. I’ll take you as far as I can.”

Dotty followed the twilight-colored fox along the riverbank, where the water began to shimmer more brightly with each step. They passed through an orchard where trees glowed softly, their branches heavy with moon-shaped fruit. The air smelled sweet, like night-blooming flowers, and the river’s hum grew louder, filling the air with gentle music.

As they traveled farther, the forest grew thinner, and soon the stars above felt close enough to touch. The fox stopped at the edge of a meadow bathed in starlight and turned to Dotty.
“This is as far as I go,” the fox said, its golden eyes glimmering kindly. “Beyond here, the river belongs to the stars themselves. You must walk the rest of the way alone.”
Dotty gave the fox a grateful nod. “Thank you for guiding me.”
The fox bowed slightly, then slipped into the shadows, vanishing as quietly as a dream. Dotty turned toward the meadow, her heart fluttering with excitement. She could hear the river’s song now, clearer and sweeter than ever, as if it were calling her forward.
She stepped carefully through the meadow, the soft grass glowing beneath her feet. At last, she reached a place where the river’s water no longer flowed—it rose into the sky, becoming a path of starlight that led toward the horizon.

Dotty gasped in wonder. The river didn’t end—it climbed into the heavens, becoming a bridge of light between the earth and the sky.
Without hesitation, Dotty stepped onto the starlit path. It felt like walking on cool water, yet each step was light and sure. The stars above and below her glimmered brightly, as if welcoming her. She followed the glowing path until, at last, she reached a place where the moon rested on the water, casting silver ripples across the sky.
And there, waiting at the edge of the starlit bridge, stood a figure—an old woman wrapped in robes woven from moonlight. Her eyes were as deep as the night sky, filled with both mystery and kindness.

“You’ve come far, little traveler,” the woman said with a smile. “Few ever make it this far.”
Dotty felt a warmth in her chest, a sense of peace she couldn’t quite explain. “Is this where the River of Stars begins?” she asked softly.
The old woman gave a gentle laugh. “The river has no beginning and no end,” she said. “It flows between worlds—between dreams and waking, between night and day. And those who walk its path find what they need most.”
Dotty tilted her head. “What do I need?”
The old woman reached out and placed a small star into Dotty’s hands. It glowed softly, warm and bright, and Dotty felt it fill her heart with a quiet joy, like the feeling of being home.
“This star will guide you,” the woman whispered. “Wherever you go, its light will remind you of the magic that lives in every moment.”
With a smile, Dotty tucked the star close to her heart. She felt as if she had discovered something far more precious than the river’s source—the knowledge that magic isn’t something to find; it’s something to carry within you.

The old woman gave her a knowing look, then gently touched Dotty’s forehead. In an instant, the starlit path faded, and Dotty found herself standing by the riverbank once more, the first light of dawn creeping over the horizon.
In her hands, the little star still glowed faintly, like a tiny spark of the night sky. Dotty smiled, knowing that no matter where she went, she carried the magic of the River of Stars with her—quiet, steady, and endless.
And from that day forward, whenever she gazed at the night sky or heard the gentle hum of the river, she remembered her journey along the starlit path and the quiet truth she had discovered: some magic can’t be seen—it must be felt.

The End.
