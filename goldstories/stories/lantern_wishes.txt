The Lantern of Wishes
Mag, Adv

In a village nestled between misty mountains, there was a tale whispered among the townsfolk—a story of an ancient, magical lantern hidden deep within the enchanted forest. They called it the Lantern of Wishes, said to grant one wish to anyone with a heart pure enough to light its flame. But the forest was a maze of twisting paths and shimmering illusions, and no one who went searching ever found the lantern.
One autumn afternoon, two best friends—Mira and Kai—sat by the edge of the forest, watching the leaves swirl in the wind. Mira had always dreamed of adventures, while Kai preferred quiet days spent drawing pictures in his sketchbook. But today, Mira was buzzing with excitement.
“Let’s find the Lantern of Wishes!” Mira said, her eyes sparkling. “We could wish for anything!”
Kai frowned. “But what if we get lost? Or what if it’s just a story?”
Mira gave him a playful nudge. “Come on, Kai. Don’t you ever wonder what it would be like to find something magical?”
Kai hesitated, but he couldn’t resist Mira’s grin. “Okay,” he sighed. “But if we meet any enchanted bears, you have to do the talking.”

The two friends packed some snacks and a blanket, then slipped into the forest. Sunlight trickled through the trees, and the air smelled like pine and fallen leaves. They followed a winding path that twisted deeper into the woods, each step taking them further from the familiar world.
As they walked, strange things began to happen. Mossy stones glowed faintly, and the trees whispered softly in a language they couldn’t understand. Then, just ahead, they saw a fox with fur as white as snow sitting on the path. Its eyes shimmered like starlight.
“Are you lost?” the fox asked, tilting its head.
Mira’s heart skipped. “We’re looking for the Lantern of Wishes. Do you know where it is?”
The fox chuckled softly. “Many have searched for it. Few find it. But perhaps you are different.” It flicked its tail and turned toward a hidden trail. “Follow me.”
The fox led them through narrow, twisting paths, past trees with branches like silver and streams that glowed under the shadow of twilight. After a while, they reached a clearing where the sky was filled with countless fireflies, their tiny lights flickering like stars.
At the center of the clearing stood an old stone pedestal, and on top of it rested a lantern made of glass and gold. But there was no flame inside—only darkness.
“This is it,” Mira whispered, her heart racing. She reached out to touch the lantern, but the fox shook its head.

“The Lantern of Wishes only lights for those who understand what they truly wish for,” the fox said. “Think carefully. A selfish wish will leave the lantern dark.”
Mira and Kai exchanged a glance. “What do we wish for?” Kai asked.
Mira thought hard. “We could wish for treasure! Or to never have homework again!” But as soon as she said the words, the lantern remained dim and cold.
Kai sat down on the grass, thinking quietly. Then, at last, he said, “What if… we just wish to always be friends, no matter where our adventures take us?”
Mira blinked in surprise. “But… we don’t need a magic lantern for that.”
“Maybe not,” Kai said, “but it’s the most important wish I can think of.”
Mira smiled. “You’re right, Kai. Let’s do it.”
Together, they placed their hands on the lantern. “We wish to always stay friends,” they whispered in unison.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a soft, warm glow, a tiny flame flickered to life inside the lantern. The glass glowed gold, and the fireflies in the clearing gathered around it, their lights swirling like dancing stars.
The fox smiled. “You have found the true magic of the Lantern of Wishes. It doesn’t grant things you can hold in your hands—it grants things that live in your heart.”
Mira and Kai stared in wonder as the flame grew brighter, filling them with a sense of peace and joy. “We did it,” Mira whispered, squeezing Kai’s hand.
The fox gave them a gentle nod. “The lantern’s magic will stay with you, even after you leave. Now, it is time to go home.”
The two friends walked back through the forest, the glow of the lantern lingering in their hearts. The path that had seemed so tangled before now felt easy and clear, as if the forest had opened itself to them.

When they reached the edge of the forest, the sun was setting, and the first stars were appearing in the sky. Mira turned to Kai with a grin. “See? I told you we’d find something magical.”
Kai laughed, and together they sat on the blanket, watching the stars come out one by one. The lantern might have stayed in the forest, but its magic—the kind that keeps friendships strong—would stay with them always.
And so, Mira and Kai never needed to make another wish. They had already found the most magical thing of all: a friendship that would last, no matter where their adventures took them.

The End.
