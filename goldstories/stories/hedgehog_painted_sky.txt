The Hedgehog Who Painted the Sky
Ani

At the farthest edge of the forest, where the hills touched the horizon, lived a tiny hedgehog named Pico. Unlike most hedgehogs, who liked to curl up and nap during the evening hours, Pico stayed awake, watching the sky change colors. He loved how the day faded into night, with the pinks, golds, and purples melting into the dark, starry sky. But Pico always felt a little sad when the sunset disappeared.
“If only I could keep those colors forever,” Pico sighed one evening, as he sat on a patch of clover. “Maybe... maybe I could paint the sky myself.”
And so, Pico decided to try.

The next morning, Pico rummaged through the forest, gathering whatever colors he could find. He plucked blue forget-me-nots and gathered dandelions as bright as sunshine. He collected the soft pink petals of wild roses and scooped up little bits of dark river mud for the twilight. With all his treasures bundled together, Pico returned to his little burrow and set to work.
He mixed and mashed the petals, leaves, and mud in acorn bowls until he had a set of beautiful paints, each color brighter than the last. But as Pico stared at his little bowls of paint, he realized he had one small problem—he didn’t know how to get the paint onto the sky.
“How does one paint something so big?” Pico wondered, tapping his paw thoughtfully.
Just then, Milo the mouse scurried by, balancing a blackberry on his head. “What are you up to, Pico?” Milo asked.
“I want to paint the sky,” Pico said, “but it’s so big! I don’t know how to reach it.”
Milo smiled. “You don’t need to reach the sky,” he said. “Just paint where you can, and see what happens.”
Pico tilted his head, considering this. “Hmm... maybe the clover field would be a good place to start.”

That night, as the sun began to dip behind the hills, Pico scurried to the clover field with his paints. He dipped his paw into the pink mixture and swirled it across the clover leaves. He dabbed yellow paint on pebbles, brushed blue across blades of grass, and smudged purple onto the bark of trees. Everywhere Pico touched, the forest seemed to glow with color, as if he had captured the sunset right there on the ground.
When he finished, Pico sat back and admired his work. The meadow shimmered like the sky itself—a sunset on the earth, just as beautiful as the one above.
Just then, a soft breeze drifted through the trees, gently lifting the painted petals and leaves from the ground. They swirled upward, caught in the breeze, and began to float toward the sky.
Pico watched in awe as the wind carried his colors higher and higher, scattering them across the horizon. The pinks, yellows, and blues danced through the twilight, blending with the stars until the whole sky shimmered like a painting come to life.

As the last of the colors settled into the night, Milo the mouse scurried back to Pico’s side. “You did it!” Milo said, his whiskers twitching with excitement. “You painted the sky!”
Pico smiled softly. “I guess I did,” he whispered.
And from that night on, the sunset always seemed a little brighter, as if the sky remembered Pico’s gift. Whenever the colors swirled across the horizon, Milo would nudge Pico and say, “There’s your painting again.”
And Pico, feeling warm and happy inside, would curl up in the clover field, knowing that sometimes, the best way to reach the sky is simply to bring a little bit of it to the ground.

The End.
