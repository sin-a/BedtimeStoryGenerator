The Dragon’s Gift
Mag

In a land where mountains touched the clouds, rivers sparkled like silver ribbons, and forests hummed with ancient magic, there lived creatures most people only knew from bedtime stories: dragons. These dragons were not fierce beasts, but guardians of the world’s wonders. They hid in secret places, protecting things that were rare and magical—things like moonlight streams, enchanted gems, and music carried on the wind.

Among these dragons was a young, bright-green dragon named Aurel. Aurel was smaller than the others and still learning his way in the world. He was curious, playful, and dreamed of being as wise and brave as the older dragons who guarded the great treasures of the world.
One morning, as the sun peeked over the snowy peaks, Aurel’s mother gave him a task: "It is time you find your own treasure to protect." Her golden eyes twinkled warmly. "But remember, the most precious things are not always what they seem."
Aurel flapped his wings with excitement and soared into the sky, the wind rushing under his scales. He flew over forests, rivers, and valleys, searching for something truly special—something he could call his own.

After a long day of flying, Aurel spotted a shimmering waterfall tucked between two cliffs. Drawn to its beauty, he glided down and perched beside the pool at the waterfall’s base. As he peered into the clear water, something unexpected happened—a tiny voice called out to him.
"Help me, please!" the voice whispered.
Aurel blinked in surprise and looked closer. Beneath the water’s surface, tangled in the roots of a water lily, was a small creature—a sprite, no bigger than a butterfly, with wings that sparkled like mist in the morning sun.
Aurel gently dipped his claws into the water and untangled the sprite from the roots. "There you go!" he said kindly, lifting her from the water.
The little sprite shivered and fluttered her damp wings. "Thank you, kind dragon!" she said, her voice as light as the breeze. "I am Mira, a water sprite, and I’ve been trapped here for days. What brings you to this hidden place?"
Aurel smiled. "I’m looking for a treasure to protect. Something rare and magical—something only I can guard."
Mira’s eyes sparkled. "Then you’re in luck! There is something truly special deep in the forest, hidden beneath the tallest tree. But it’s not easy to find. Would you like me to show you?"
Aurel’s wings fluttered with excitement. "Yes, please!"

The little sprite led Aurel through the forest, her wings trailing tiny sparkles in the air. They flew past glimmering streams and groves of whispering trees, until they reached a massive oak tree whose roots burrowed deep into the earth.
"Here it is," Mira whispered, pointing to the base of the tree.
Aurel leaned in and saw a glowing egg, nestled safely among the roots. It shimmered with soft light, like the glow of the moon on a calm night. The egg was small, but Aurel could feel the magic inside it—it was unlike anything he had ever sensed before.
"This," Mira explained, "is the last of the Dreamweaver eggs. When it hatches, the dragon inside will weave dreams into the sky, spreading wonder and hope to all creatures. But the egg is delicate, and it needs a guardian to protect it until it hatches."
Aurel stared at the glowing egg, his heart swelling with awe. "I’ll protect it," he whispered. "I’ll keep it safe, no matter what."
Mira smiled. "I knew you would."

Days passed, and Aurel stayed by the egg, guarding it through storms, winds, and even curious creatures that wandered too close. At night, he curled his tail protectively around the glowing egg, humming soft songs to it as it shimmered beneath the stars.
But one evening, a shadow passed over the forest. Aurel looked up to see a great black dragon circling above—a dragon known as Umbra, the keeper of forgotten things.
Umbra landed with a thud, her dark scales gleaming like obsidian. "That egg belongs to the Dreamweavers," she said in a deep, rumbling voice. "It is too precious for a small dragon like you to guard. Give it to me, and I will keep it safe."
Aurel stood tall, though his heart pounded in his chest. "I may be small," he said bravely, "but this is my treasure to protect. I promised to guard it, and I won’t let anyone take it."
Umbra’s eyes narrowed, but then, to Aurel’s surprise, she gave a slow, approving nod. "You have a brave heart, little dragon," she said. "Bravery is a treasure in itself. The Dreamweaver egg is lucky to have you."
With a powerful sweep of her wings, Umbra rose into the sky and disappeared into the night, leaving Aurel with the egg.

At dawn, just as the first rays of sunlight touched the treetops, the egg began to glow brighter. Aurel watched in amazement as tiny cracks appeared along its surface, shimmering with light. And then, with a soft pop, the egg hatched.
Out tumbled a tiny dragon, no bigger than a sparrow, with scales that sparkled like stardust. The little dragon blinked up at Aurel, its eyes full of wonder, and let out the smallest, happiest chirp.
"You did it," Mira whispered, fluttering beside him. "The Dreamweaver is born."
Aurel smiled, feeling a warmth spread through his heart. He knew now that the greatest treasure wasn’t gold or jewels—it was the joy of caring for something magical, something fragile, and seeing it thrive.

From that day forward, Aurel and the little Dreamweaver dragon became inseparable. They soared through the skies together, weaving dreams into the stars, spreading wonder and hope wherever they flew.
And though Aurel had once been small and unsure, he knew now that even the smallest dragon could guard the greatest treasures—as long as he did so with love, bravery, and a heart full of magic.

The End.
