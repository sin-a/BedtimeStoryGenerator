The Clockmaker’s Gift
Mag

In a small town where the streets curled like ribbons and the rooftops tilted at odd angles, there was a little shop tucked between two tall chimneys. The faded sign above the door read:
"Oliver’s Clockworks – Time Repaired While You Wait."
Inside the shop, among ticking clocks and the soft hum of gears, worked Oliver, a quiet clockmaker with kind eyes and steady hands. Oliver spent his days fixing all sorts of timepieces—grandfather clocks, pocket watches, and even little alarm clocks that never seemed to ring on time.
But Oliver didn’t just repair clocks. He also mended moments—those little slivers of time that got lost, forgotten, or tangled. It was a secret gift of his, though he never told anyone about it.
Some days, when a watch came in with a cracked face, Oliver could feel the memory trapped inside it—a birthday wish made too late, a sunny morning that slipped away too quickly, or a conversation that ended just a little too soon. Oliver couldn’t turn back time, but he could fix what was broken, gently smoothing out the lost moments so they didn’t hurt as much.

One rainy afternoon, the little bell over the shop door jingled, and in walked Mae, a girl with a yellow raincoat and a satchel full of treasures—dried flowers, bottle caps, and buttons from coats long lost.
Mae placed a small, silver pocket watch on the counter. “Can you fix this?” she asked, her voice soft. “It was my grandfather’s.”
Oliver picked up the watch and turned it over in his hands. The silver casing was scratched, and the hands were frozen at exactly 2:17. Oliver could feel something delicate nestled within the watch—a moment that had slipped away and been left behind.
He gave Mae a kind smile. “Of course. I just need a little time.”
Mae sat on a stool, swinging her feet as Oliver carefully opened the back of the watch. Inside, the tiny gears were worn and tired, but something else caught Oliver’s attention—a small, folded piece of paper, tucked beneath the clockwork. It was so old that the edges had softened like petals.
He unfolded it gently, revealing a note written in neat, careful handwriting:"Don’t forget the promise."
Oliver’s hands stilled for a moment. He looked at Mae, who was watching the rain fall outside the window, her face quiet with thought.
“What promise?” Oliver asked softly.
Mae shrugged. “I don’t know. My grandfather always carried that watch, but he never told me why. I just liked the way it ticked.”
Oliver smiled, winding the gears gently back into place. “I think I might know.”

Oliver worked quietly, letting the sound of the rain and the hum of the clocks fill the room. With a few careful turns of his tools, the pocket watch began to tick again, its hands moving smoothly around the face.
But Oliver wasn’t finished yet. He placed the little piece of folded paper back inside the watch, right where it had rested for so many years. And as he closed the casing, something magical happened—not with sparks or spells, but with a soft, quiet feeling, like the moment just before a wish is made.
The pocket watch gave a contented tick, as if it were thanking Oliver for mending more than just gears. And when Oliver handed it back to Mae, the frozen moment inside the watch—2:17—began to flow gently forward once more, carrying with it the promise that had never quite been fulfilled.

Mae turned the watch over in her hands, her fingers tracing the worn silver edges. The ticking sounded familiar, like the quiet rhythm of time well spent. She looked up at Oliver with a small smile. “I think I understand now,” she whispered, though she couldn’t quite explain what she meant.
Oliver nodded, as if he understood too. Some moments couldn’t be captured in words—they simply drifted through time, waiting to be noticed.
“Thank you,” Mae said, slipping the watch into her satchel.
The bell above the door jingled as Mae left the shop, her yellow raincoat disappearing into the misty streets. Oliver stood by the window, watching the rain soften the edges of the world.

After Mae had gone, Oliver returned to his workbench, winding the clocks and adjusting the gears. But that afternoon, something in the air felt lighter—like a promise that had finally been remembered.
And in the quiet of his little shop, Oliver smiled to himself. Fixing clocks was important, but mending moments—those delicate, hidden bits of time—was the greatest gift he could offer.
Because sometimes, all a moment needed was a little attention and care. And sometimes, that was enough to bring a lost promise back to life.

The End.
