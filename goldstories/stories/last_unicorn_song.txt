The Last Unicorn's Song
Mag

In a faraway land, where the rivers shimmered like silver ribbons and the hills rolled like waves of emerald, there was a deep forest called Moonveil Wood. The forest was ancient, filled with towering trees that whispered secrets on the wind, and it was said that somewhere, hidden in its quietest glades, lived the last of the unicorns.

No one in the nearby village had seen the unicorn, but everyone had heard stories. The elders spoke of its shimmering white coat, its golden horn that sparkled like sunlight on water, and the song it was said to sing—a song so beautiful that it could make the stars themselves weep. But those were just tales, and many thought the unicorn had disappeared forever.
Ayla, however, believed. She was a quiet girl who spent her days wandering the edge of the forest, listening to the birds and the rustling leaves. Her heart was full of wonder, and though she had never seen the unicorn herself, she knew it was still out there, somewhere.
One cool autumn evening, as the first stars began to blink into the dusky sky, Ayla sat by the river that bordered Moonveil Wood, humming a soft tune to herself. The night was still, save for the gentle flow of the water, and as Ayla sat, she heard something strange—a sound so soft, so faint, that at first, she thought she was imagining it.
It was a song.

The sound was like a melody carried on the wind, delicate and haunting. Ayla’s heart quickened. She stood up, straining her ears, and realized that the sound was coming from deep within the forest.
Without a second thought, she began to follow it.
The trees seemed to part as she walked, their branches glowing faintly in the starlight. The deeper she went, the clearer the song became, until it wrapped around her like a blanket of sound. It was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard—sad, yet full of hope, as though it carried the weight of countless forgotten dreams.
At last, Ayla stepped into a small, hidden glade. And there, bathed in the silver light of the moon, stood the unicorn.

Ayla’s breath caught in her throat. The unicorn was even more beautiful than she had imagined. Its coat shimmered like snow beneath the stars, and its mane flowed like silk in the night breeze. A single golden horn spiraled from its forehead, glowing softly, and its deep blue eyes held the secrets of the universe.
The unicorn stood still, its head lowered slightly as it sang its mournful song. The air around it seemed to glow with magic, and the ground beneath its hooves sparkled with soft stardust.
Ayla didn’t dare move. She didn’t want to disturb the unicorn, didn’t want the moment to end. But the unicorn, sensing her presence, lifted its head and turned to face her.
For a long moment, they simply stared at one another. Ayla felt a strange connection, as though the unicorn could see not just her face, but her heart—the part of her that believed in magic, in wonder, in all the things that others had forgotten.

“You heard my song,” the unicorn said, its voice as soft as the wind. “Few can hear it now.”
Ayla nodded, her heart pounding. “I’ve always believed in you,” she whispered.
The unicorn stepped forward, its hooves barely making a sound on the soft earth. “The world is changing,” it said, its eyes full of sorrow. “Magic is fading. There are fewer and fewer who believe, and without belief, I cannot stay.”
Ayla’s heart ached at the unicorn’s words. “But you’re still here,” she said. “I found you.”
The unicorn gazed at her for a long moment, then nodded. “Yes. And that is why I sang—for you.”
Ayla didn’t understand. “For me?”
The unicorn lowered its head, its horn glowing faintly. “I am the last of my kind. My song is not just a song—it is a gift. A way to pass on the magic of the unicorns to those who believe. You, Ayla, have a heart full of wonder. You carry the magic of the world within you.”
Ayla felt tears prick her eyes. “What will happen to you?” she asked softly.
The unicorn smiled—a small, sad smile. “I will return to the stars, where I came from. But the magic will live on in you. As long as you carry it, as long as you believe, the world will never be without wonder.”
Ayla stepped forward, reaching out her hand. The unicorn bent its head, and its golden horn brushed lightly against her palm. A soft, warm light flowed from the unicorn to Ayla, filling her with a sense of peace, of hope, of endless possibility.

When the light faded, the unicorn took a step back, its coat shimmering like a thousand stars. “Remember,” it said softly, “magic is not something you hold in your hands. It is something you carry in your heart.”
Ayla nodded, her heart full of emotions she couldn’t quite name. “I won’t forget,” she promised.
The unicorn gave her one last, gentle look, then turned toward the sky. With a leap as graceful as a whisper, it rose into the air, its hooves barely touching the ground as it ascended higher and higher. The stars seemed to brighten as the unicorn soared into the night, its body fading into the starlight until it was gone.

Ayla stood alone in the glade, the unicorn’s song still echoing in her heart.
From that day on, she carried the unicorn’s magic with her, a quiet, glowing presence that filled her with wonder. And though no one else in the village believed her story, Ayla didn’t mind. She knew the truth—that magic was real, that unicorns had once roamed the world, and that as long as there were hearts like hers, full of belief and hope, the magic would never truly fade.

The End.
