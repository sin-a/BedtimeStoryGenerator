The Saturday Morning Market
Fam

Every Saturday morning, Sofia and her dad had a tradition. They woke up early, long before the rest of the town, and headed to the farmers’ market. It was their special time together—just Sofia, Dad, and the promise of fresh bread, sweet fruit, and little surprises along the way.
Sofia loved everything about the market. The colors, the smells, the sounds of vendors chatting and calling out to customers—it all felt like a tiny adventure.
As they walked toward the market, Sofia held her dad’s hand, her other hand gripping the small shopping list they had made the night before.
“So, what’s first on the list, assistant shopper?” Dad asked playfully.
Sofia unfolded the list. “Eggs,” she read aloud. “And then blueberries for pancakes.”
“Eggs and blueberries,” Dad repeated. “Perfect. Let’s get to work.”

At the egg stand, they met Mrs. Phelps, who had been selling eggs at the market for as long as Sofia could remember. Mrs. Phelps gave Sofia a warm smile. “Morning, Sofia! Would you like to pick your eggs?”
Sofia carefully selected a dozen eggs, checking each one to make sure it wasn’t cracked. Mrs. Phelps packed them into a carton and added a little feather on top. “A lucky feather for my best customer,” she said with a wink.
Sofia smiled. “Thank you!”
Next, they stopped by Mr. Patel’s fruit stall, where crates of blueberries, strawberries, and peaches shimmered under the morning sun.
“Here to stock up for pancakes, I see,” Mr. Patel said with a grin, already knowing their usual routine.
Sofia nodded eagerly. “Yes, please! Can I pick the blueberries?”
“Of course,” Mr. Patel said, handing her a basket.
Sofia carefully chose the plumpest, juiciest blueberries she could find. She gave one a gentle squeeze to make sure it wasn’t too soft, and when she was satisfied, she handed the basket to her dad.
“Excellent work,” Dad said. “These are going to make some incredible pancakes.”

As they continued their way through the market, Sofia’s favorite part was always stopping at the bread stand. The smell of fresh-baked bread and pastries filled the air, making her stomach rumble. The baker, Ms. Lena, waved at them from behind her counter.
“Morning, Sofia! The usual loaf of sourdough?”
Sofia grinned. “Yes! And maybe… one of those chocolate croissants?”
Ms. Lena laughed. “I thought you might ask.” She wrapped up a croissant in paper and handed it to Sofia. “A little treat for my best helper.”
Sofia’s dad gave her a knowing smile. “I guess it’s okay to spoil my shopping assistant today.”
Sofia beamed, clutching the warm croissant in her hands. It felt like a little treasure.

Once they had everything on their list, Sofia and her dad wandered through the rest of the market, just for fun. They stopped to listen to a man playing guitar, watched a woman weave baskets from colorful strips of cloth, and petted a friendly golden retriever sitting beside a flower stall.
At the very end of the market, they found something new—a small booth selling potted herbs. Sofia’s eyes lit up. She had always wanted to grow something of her own.
“Can we get one?” she asked, tugging on her dad’s sleeve.
“Hmm... What kind of herb would you take care of?” Dad asked with a grin.
Sofia studied the plants. There were rosemary, thyme, and mint, but one little pot caught her eye—it held a tiny basil plant, its leaves bright green and fragrant.
“This one,” Sofia said firmly. “We can use it for pizza!”
“Pizza basil!” Dad said with a chuckle. “Good choice.”
They bought the plant and tucked it carefully into their bag, along with the eggs, blueberries, and bread. Sofia felt proud knowing she would help take care of the little plant and watch it grow.

When they arrived home, Sofia and her dad unpacked their market finds. Sofia set the basil plant on the kitchen windowsill, right where it would get plenty of sunlight. Then she helped her dad crack eggs, stir pancake batter, and fold in the fresh blueberries she had picked so carefully.
As the pancakes sizzled on the stove, Sofia set the table with plates, forks, and napkins. She even poured two glasses of milk—one for her and one for Dad.
The first pancake flipped perfectly golden-brown, and soon they sat down together, their plates stacked high with pancakes dripping in syrup. Sofia took a bite and grinned. The blueberries were just right—sweet, juicy, and bursting with flavor.
“These are the best pancakes ever,” she declared, her mouth full.
Dad laughed. “Well, they were picked by the best assistant shopper, after all.”
They finished their breakfast, chatting and laughing, and when they were done, Sofia climbed onto a chair to check on the basil plant. Its little leaves still looked bright and happy in the sunshine.
“I think our basil is going to love it here,” Sofia said proudly.
Dad smiled, resting a hand on her shoulder. “Just like I love spending time with you.”
Sofia leaned against him, her heart full and happy. “Me too, Dad. I can’t wait to go back to the market next Saturday.”
And from that day on, their Saturday mornings became more than just a trip to the farmers’ market. It became a tradition they both looked forward to—a little adventure filled with familiar faces, simple joys, and the sweetest memories made together.

The End.
