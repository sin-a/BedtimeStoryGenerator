The Big Tree
Adv

Lily and Ben were the best of friends. They lived in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and spent every afternoon playing outside. But today was different. Today, they wanted to explore the woods behind their neighborhood, a place they had never gone before.
“The big tree is waiting for us!” Lily announced excitedly. She had heard older kids talk about a giant tree in the middle of the woods. It was supposed to have branches that spread out like a castle in the sky.
“But... what if we get lost?” Ben asked nervously.
“We won’t,” Lily said confidently. “We’ll find the big tree together, and if we stick close, everything will be fine!”

With that, the two friends tied their shoelaces tight, zipped up their backpacks filled with snacks, and set off on their adventure.
The woods were tall and filled with winding paths. The trees whispered in the breeze, and birds chirped happily. As they walked, Lily kept her eyes ahead, leading the way, while Ben made sure to remember every twist and turn.
“Look at these leaves!” Lily said, picking up a bright red one. “It’s like nature’s painting.”
Ben smiled. “And I found an acorn! We can collect them as souvenirs.”
Soon, they came across a fork in the path. One way was a sunny trail, and the other led through a tunnel of trees, dark and shadowy.
“Let’s take the tunnel!” Lily said eagerly, pointing to the shaded path.
Ben frowned. “It looks spooky... what if we get scared?”
Lily grinned. “That’s what friends are for! If one of us gets scared, the other can help.”
Ben took a deep breath. “Okay. We can do this.”
They walked through the shady path, holding hands for courage. It was quiet, except for the crunch of leaves under their feet. But after a few minutes, they spotted light peeking through the trees.
“We made it!” Ben cheered, and they both ran forward.

On the other side, they found something amazing—the big tree! It stood taller than any of the others, with branches spreading far and wide.
“Wow,” Lily whispered in awe. “It’s even bigger than I imagined!”
“Let’s climb it!” Ben said, his nervousness from earlier gone.
They found a low branch to start, and soon they were climbing higher and higher, helping each other along the way. When Ben struggled to reach a branch, Lily gave him a boost. When Lily got stuck, Ben pointed out a better way.
Finally, they reached a wide, sturdy branch high above the ground. They sat down, their legs dangling over the side, and looked out at the forest below. The sunlight filtered through the leaves, making everything glow.
“This is the best view ever!” Lily said, taking a deep breath.
“And we did it together,” Ben added proudly.
They shared their snacks—apple slices and peanut butter crackers—while chatting about all the things they had seen.

After a while, Lily looked at Ben. “Thanks for coming with me. I know you were nervous, but I couldn’t have done this without you.”
Ben smiled. “I was nervous... but it was way more fun doing it with you.”
When the sun started to set, they carefully climbed down the tree and made their way back along the paths. This time, Ben led the way, and Lily followed, trusting him completely.
By the time they reached their neighborhood, the sky was a beautiful orange, and the streetlights had just flickered on.
“That was the best adventure ever!” Lily said as they reached Ben’s front door.
“And we’ll have even more,” Ben replied. “As long as we have each other.”
They gave each other a high-five and promised to explore again soon.
And from that day on, whenever one of them felt nervous or scared, the other would say: “We can do this—together.”

The End.
