The Quest for the Lost Island
Mag, Adv

Lila was not your typical 10-year-old. While other kids spent their afternoons glued to video games, Lila preferred exploring the forest behind her house with her best friend, Sam. They called themselves "The Brave Seekers" because they were always searching for mysteries to solve. But today was different—today, they had found something truly remarkable.
It all began when Lila stumbled upon a strange, yellowed map tucked inside an old book in her attic. The map showed a mysterious island hidden deep in the ocean, labeled only as The Lost Island of Merlo. According to the notes scribbled in the margins, the island was said to contain treasure beyond imagination, guarded by ancient creatures.
"Do you think it’s real?" Sam asked, squinting at the map.
"There’s only one way to find out," Lila declared, excitement bubbling in her chest.
The two friends packed their backpacks with snacks, flashlights, and binoculars, then cycled to the harbor where Lila's uncle, Captain Jake, kept his small fishing boat.
"Ahoy, young adventurers!" Captain Jake greeted them with a chuckle. "Off on another quest, are you?"
"Not just any quest," Lila said, holding up the map. "We’re going to find The Lost Island of Merlo!"
Jake’s eyes widened. "Well, you kids better watch out—the legends say strange things happen around that island."
But he knew the adventurous spark in his niece’s eyes couldn’t be dimmed. So, with the wind in their sails, they set off into the open sea.

For hours, the boat cruised across the water, with Sam navigating the map and Lila keeping a lookout through her binoculars. Just as the sun began to dip below the horizon, they spotted it—a faint outline of land rising from the mist.
"We found it!" Sam shouted.
But just as they neared the island, dark clouds gathered overhead, and the sea began to churn. Waves crashed against the boat, rocking it violently from side to side. Lila and Sam gripped the railing as Captain Jake fought to keep the boat steady.
Out of nowhere, a massive whirlpool formed, pulling the boat closer and closer to its swirling center. "Hold on!" Captain Jake shouted, but it was too late—the whirlpool swallowed them whole.
Lila closed her eyes, bracing for impact. When she opened them again, the storm was gone, and the boat had drifted gently to shore. They were on the Lost Island.

The island was like nothing they had ever seen. Towering trees with glowing leaves stretched towards the sky, and strange birds with rainbow feathers sang unfamiliar songs. Lila and Sam hopped out of the boat, their feet sinking into the soft, golden sand.
"Look at that!" Sam whispered, pointing to a path made of smooth stones leading into the forest.
They followed the path, hearts racing with excitement. After hiking through lush greenery and crossing a bridge made of vines, they reached a clearing—and in the center stood a giant stone statue of a dragon.
"The Guardian of the Treasure," Lila whispered, remembering the notes on the map.
Beneath the statue lay a small chest, half-buried in the ground. With a grin, Sam dug it out and lifted the lid. Inside, they found not gold or jewels, but a sparkling blue gem that glowed in the moonlight.
Suddenly, the ground trembled, and the dragon statue’s eyes lit up. The stone beast began to stir, slowly rising to its feet. Lila and Sam stared in awe—and fear.

The dragon lowered its massive head, studying the two adventurers with glowing eyes. "You have found the Heart of Merlo," it rumbled. "But only those with brave hearts may take it."
Lila’s legs trembled, but she stepped forward. "We didn’t come here for treasure," she said. "We just wanted to find out if the stories were true. And if this belongs to the island, we don’t want to take it away."
The dragon’s eyes softened, and a deep, rumbling laugh echoed through the clearing. "You have chosen wisely, young seeker," it said. "The greatest treasure is not what you take, but what you discover within yourself."
With that, the dragon gently blew a warm breath over Lila and Sam. The glowing gem floated back into the chest, and the dragon returned to stone, as still as it had been before.

Lila and Sam made their way back to the boat, feeling lighter than ever. The storm had cleared, and the night sky was filled with stars. As Captain Jake steered them home, Lila looked at her friend and smiled.
"We might not have gold, but we found something even better," she said.
"Yeah," Sam agreed. "The best adventure of our lives."
And as they sailed away from the Lost Island of Merlo, they knew that no matter where life took them, the spirit of adventure would always be with them.

The End.
