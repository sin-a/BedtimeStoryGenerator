The Fairy Parade
Mag

Every summer, on the night when the first fireflies lit up the meadows, the village children whispered excitedly about the Fairy Parade. It was said that if you stayed awake and waited quietly by the forest’s edge, you might catch a glimpse of fairies dancing through the trees, carrying tiny lanterns and spreading magic in their wake.

But Lucas had never seen the Fairy Parade, no matter how hard he tried. Every year, he would sit patiently by the old oak tree, eyes wide and ears alert, but the fairies never appeared. Some of the other children teased him, saying the fairies weren’t real. But Lucas knew, deep down, that they were.
One warm evening in late June, Lucas decided that this year, he wouldn’t give up. He packed a blanket, a lantern, and a little jar of cookies — just in case the fairies got hungry — and set off to the forest’s edge as the sun dipped below the hills.

The night was soft and warm, the stars twinkling above like friendly eyes. Lucas settled under the oak tree, his blanket wrapped around him, and waited. And waited.
The wind whispered through the leaves. A cricket chirped nearby. The moon climbed higher in the sky. But still, no fairies appeared.
Just as Lucas’s eyelids started to droop, a soft, glimmering light caught his eye. It was coming from deeper inside the forest — faint at first, like the glow of a single firefly, but then more lights appeared, twinkling through the trees like stars come to life.
Lucas’s heart leapt. The fairies! They were real!
Without a second thought, Lucas grabbed his lantern and crept toward the glowing lights, careful not to make a sound. The deeper he went into the forest, the brighter the lights became, until the trees opened into a secret clearing bathed in soft starlight.
And there they were: the fairies.

Tiny, radiant creatures no taller than Lucas’s hand, their wings shimmering like dewdrops in the moonlight. Some wore gowns made of petals, others had cloaks woven from spider silk, and each one carried a tiny lantern glowing with magic light. They floated through the air, their laughter as light as a breeze, spinning and twirling in a dance so graceful it made Lucas’s heart swell with wonder.
Lucas stood still, too enchanted to move, afraid that even the smallest sound would frighten them away. But then, as if sensing his presence, one of the fairies turned and saw him. Her wings glimmered like stardust, and she had bright, curious eyes that sparkled with mischief.
“You’re awake!” the fairy said in a voice as light as a bell. “Finally, someone stayed awake to see the parade!”
Lucas smiled shyly. “I’ve been waiting for so long,” he whispered.
The fairy giggled. “We know! We’ve seen you every year by the old oak tree. We wondered when you’d come join us.”
Before Lucas could reply, the fairy zipped closer and held out her tiny hand. “Come on! You can’t just watch the parade — you have to be part of it!”
Lucas hesitated for only a moment, then placed his hand near hers. With a twinkle of magic, the fairy waved her tiny wand, and suddenly, Lucas felt as light as a leaf on the wind.

He gasped as his feet lifted off the ground. He was flying!
The fairies laughed with delight and gathered around him, swirling like a dance of fireflies. “Come on!” they called. “The parade is starting!”
Lucas grinned, his heart bursting with joy, and joined the fairies as they soared through the forest. They twirled around branches, skipped over streams, and floated between glowing flowers. Everywhere they went, magic spread in their wake — flowers bloomed brighter, leaves shimmered with moonlight, and the fireflies joined the dance, their lights flickering in rhythm with the fairies’ song.

As they danced, the fairy who had found Lucas zipped up beside him. “You’re a natural!” she said with a grin. “Have you ever thought about becoming an honorary fairy?”
Lucas’s eyes widened. “Can I really?”
The fairy winked. “Of course! All it takes is a little belief — and maybe a cookie.”
Lucas laughed and reached into his pocket, pulling out the jar of cookies he’d brought. The fairies cheered as they each took a tiny crumb, nibbling happily.
“This is the best night ever,” Lucas whispered to himself, spinning through the air with the fairies.
The parade continued until the first light of dawn began to peek over the horizon. As the sky turned soft and pink, the fairies began to drift back to their hidden homes among the leaves and flowers.
“You’ll come again, won’t you?” the fairy asked as Lucas’s feet gently touched the ground once more.
Lucas smiled. “Every year,” he promised.

The fairy beamed, her wings glowing faintly in the early morning light. “We’ll be waiting!”
With a final twirl, the fairies vanished into the trees, leaving only a faint shimmer of magic in the air.
Lucas stood quietly, his heart full of happiness. He knew the other children might not believe him, but that didn’t matter. He had danced with fairies, flown through the forest, and shared cookies with magical creatures. And every summer from that night on, he knew exactly where he would be — right at the edge of the forest, waiting for the Fairy Parade to begin.

The End.
