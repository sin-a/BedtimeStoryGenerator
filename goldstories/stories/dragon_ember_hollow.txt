The Dragon of Ember Hollow
Mag

In a land where rolling hills touched the sky and mist curled like whispers over the valleys, there was a small village called Ember Hollow. The villagers were simple folk, farmers and storytellers, who loved to sit by their hearths and speak of the days when dragons still roamed the land.
Dragons had disappeared long ago, and only the oldest of the elders still remembered the tales of their greatness—how they guarded the mountains, their scales shimmering like jewels, and how their breath could warm even the coldest nights. But those were just stories now, and no one believed they would ever see a dragon again.
No one, that is, except for Lina.

Lina was a girl with a heart full of dreams and a spirit full of adventure. While the other children played in the fields, Lina would wander to the edge of the forest, staring up at the mist-covered mountains, hoping for a glimpse of something magical. She always believed that dragons were real, even if no one else did.
One autumn evening, as the village prepared for the Harvest Festival, Lina heard a strange sound—a deep, rumbling noise that seemed to come from the sky. She looked up just in time to see a shadow sweeping across the clouds, a shape too large to be a bird, with wings that seemed to stretch across the horizon.
Her heart skipped a beat. “A dragon!” she whispered, excitement bubbling up inside her.
Without a second thought, Lina raced toward the mountains, her feet flying over the hills as the sun began to dip behind the peaks. She didn’t stop until she reached the edge of the forest, where the trees grew tall and twisted, and the air smelled of pine and earth.
And then, in the clearing just ahead, she saw it.
A dragon.

It was the most magnificent creature she had ever seen. Its scales were a deep, fiery red, like glowing embers, and its eyes gleamed like molten gold. Smoke curled from its nostrils as it lay coiled on a bed of rocks, its long, spiked tail swaying gently behind it.
Lina’s breath caught in her throat. The dragon was real. And it was right in front of her.
For a moment, she didn’t dare move. But then the dragon turned its head, and its golden eyes locked onto hers.
“You’re not afraid,” the dragon rumbled, its voice deep and ancient, like the shifting of mountains.
Lina swallowed hard. “No,” she said softly. “I’m not.”
The dragon raised its head, studying her with curiosity. “Most would run from a creature like me.”
Lina shook her head. “I’ve been waiting to see a dragon my whole life.”
The dragon’s eyes narrowed, a flicker of something like amusement in them. “Have you now? And what would a small human like you do with a dragon?”
Lina hesitated, then spoke from her heart. “I don’t want to do anything. I just… I want to understand.”
The dragon blinked, clearly surprised by her answer. “Understand what?”
“Why dragons disappeared,” Lina said. “Why you’re all gone.”
For a long moment, the dragon was silent, its gaze distant. Then it spoke, its voice softer this time. “We did not leave because we wanted to. The world changed, and we no longer fit in it.”
“What do you mean?” Lina asked, stepping closer.

The dragon’s golden eyes watched her carefully. “There was a time when humans and dragons lived in harmony. We guarded the mountains, kept the rivers flowing, and shared the skies with birds and clouds. But over time, humans grew afraid of us. They saw our size, our fire, and thought we were dangerous. So they drove us away, until we had no place left to go.”
Lina’s heart ached. “That’s not fair,” she whispered.
The dragon lowered its head, resting it gently on the ground. “No, it wasn’t. But that is the way of things. Now we live in hidden places, in the deepest caves and the highest peaks, where the world cannot reach us.”
“But you came here,” Lina said, looking up at the dragon with wide eyes. “Why?”
The dragon let out a long, slow breath, smoke curling from its nostrils. “The world is changing again. Magic, which once flowed freely, is fading. The mountains no longer hum with ancient songs, and the rivers grow quiet. I came to see if there were still those who remembered—those who believed in things beyond what they can see.”
Lina felt a lump rise in her throat. “I believe.”
The dragon’s eyes softened. “Yes, I can see that. And it is why I will give you something special.”
Lina stepped closer, her heart pounding with excitement. “What is it?”
The dragon raised one of its great wings, revealing a single, glowing scale nestled among the others. The scale was bright red, like a living ember, and it pulsed with a soft, warm light.
“This scale carries the last of the old magic,” the dragon said. “As long as you keep it safe, magic will never fully fade from this world.”
Lina reached out, her fingers trembling as she took the scale. It was warm to the touch, like holding a piece of the sun.
“Thank you,” she whispered.

The dragon rumbled softly, almost like a purr. “Keep it close to your heart, and it will guide you. But remember, the true magic is not in the scale—it is in the belief that magic still exists, even in the quietest corners of the world.”
Lina nodded, clutching the scale to her chest. “I won’t forget.”
The dragon rose to its full height, its wings stretching wide, casting a shadow over the clearing. “I must go now, back to the mountains. But know this—dragons are never truly gone. We are simply waiting for the world to believe in us again.”
With a powerful beat of its wings, the dragon lifted into the sky, its great form disappearing into the clouds. Lina watched it go, her heart full of wonder and warmth.
She stood in the clearing for a long time, feeling the weight of the glowing scale in her hand. Then, as the last light of day faded, she turned and made her way back to Ember Hollow.
And from that day forward, Lina carried the dragon’s scale with her, a reminder that magic was real, and that even in a world that sometimes forgot, there were always those who believed.

The End.
