The Winter Witch’s Feather
Mag

In a village nestled at the edge of the world, winter came early and lingered late, wrapping the land in soft snow and glimmering frost. Children told stories of a mysterious being called the Winter Witch—a magical woman who rode the winds, painting the world white with her icy breath. Some said she was kind, others said she was cold and distant, but no one had ever seen her… until the day Christina found a feather.

It was no ordinary feather. It shimmered like moonlight, with frost patterns along its edges and colors that shifted between silver and pale blue. Christina had been walking through the woods, following the crunch of snow beneath her boots, when she spotted it resting gently on a snow-covered branch.
As soon as she picked it up, the wind stirred around her, and a flurry of snowflakes danced through the air. Christina clutched the feather tightly, her breath visible in the cold air.
Just then, she heard a soft, lilting voice:“You’ve found something precious, little one.”
Christina spun around to see a tall woman standing before her, draped in a cloak of snowflakes and mist. Her hair flowed like silver threads in the wind, and her eyes sparkled with frost. Christina knew at once who it was.
“Are you… the Winter Witch?” she whispered.
The woman smiled gently. “I am. And that feather you hold belongs to me. It fell from my cloak on the wind.”

Christina looked down at the feather, her heart racing. “It’s so beautiful,” she said softly. “But... if it’s so important, why didn’t you come to find it yourself?”
The Winter Witch’s smile faded slightly. “I have many tasks, child. I fly across the world, bringing snow and cold to places that need rest. But even I cannot be everywhere at once.”
Christina thought for a moment, then made up her mind. “If you need the feather, I’ll bring it back to you! Wherever you go, I’ll follow.”
The Winter Witch arched an eyebrow, her icy eyes twinkling with surprise. “You would go on such an adventure? The path I travel is cold and wild.”
Christina nodded firmly. “I’m not afraid.”
The Winter Witch’s smile returned, this time warmer, though the air remained cool. “Then let us go together.” She held out her hand.

Christina took it, and at that moment, the wind lifted them both off the ground. The forest below blurred into a snowy swirl as they soared into the sky, higher than the tallest mountain peaks. Christina laughed with delight as snowflakes swirled around her, each one glimmering like a tiny star.
They flew through clouds heavy with snow, across frozen rivers that glittered like glass, and over sleeping forests wrapped in frost. Everywhere they went, the Winter Witch’s touch brought quiet beauty—snow-covered fields and glistening icicles, peaceful and still.

As they flew, the Winter Witch told Christina stories: of snow dragons that slumbered beneath glaciers, of ice flowers that only bloom under the northern lights, and of creatures called frost foxes that leave sparkling footprints wherever they go. Christina listened with wide eyes, her heart full of wonder.
After what felt like hours, they reached a place where the stars seemed close enough to touch—a hidden land at the top of the world, blanketed in eternal snow. There, the Winter Witch’s cloak billowed around her, shimmering like the night sky.
“You’ve brought the feather back, just as you promised,” the Winter Witch said, her voice soft. She took the feather from Christina’s hand and tucked it into her cloak, where it glowed softly.
“Thank you, little one,” the witch said. “You have a kind heart and a brave spirit. I will leave you a gift, so you will always remember this journey.”
She reached into her cloak and pulled out a small crystal pendant, shaped like a snowflake. It sparkled with the same magic as her feather. “This pendant holds a piece of winter’s magic,” she explained. “Whenever you need a little wonder in your world, it will glow.”
Christina stared at the pendant in awe. “Thank you,” she whispered.

The Winter Witch gave her one last smile, then touched Christina’s forehead with a fingertip as light as snow. Before Christina knew it, she was standing back in the woods near her village, the snow crunching beneath her boots once more. The wind had grown still, and the world was quiet.
In her hand, the crystal pendant glimmered softly, as if to say, “Yes, it was real.”
Christina smiled to herself. She knew that no one in the village would believe her story, but that didn’t matter. The magic of her adventure lived in her heart—and whenever she held the pendant, she could feel the winter wind on her face, hear the soft voice of the Winter Witch, and remember the beauty of the world hidden high in the stars.
And every winter after that, whenever the snowflakes began to fall, Christina would look to the sky, hoping to see a shimmer of silver on the wind—a sign that the Winter Witch was flying by.

The End.
