The Lemonade Stand
Fam

It was the first week of summer vacation, and Ben and Eli had come up with a big idea: they were going to run the best lemonade stand in the neighborhood. Ben, the older brother, liked to plan everything. He stood in the backyard, holding a notebook and tapping his pencil on his chin.
“We need good lemonade, a cool sign, and the perfect spot,” Ben said, looking serious.
Eli, the younger brother, was already bouncing with excitement. “And lots of customers! Then we can buy ice cream!”

Ben rolled his eyes but smiled. “First, we need to get everything ready. I’ll make the lemonade. You do the sign.”
Eli gave a thumbs-up. “It’s gonna be the best sign ever.”
Ben grabbed a bag of lemons from the fridge, set them on the kitchen counter, and got to work squeezing them into a big pitcher. Juice squirted everywhere—on the counter, the floor, even his shirt—but Ben was too focused to care. Meanwhile, Eli sprawled out on the grass in the backyard with markers and a big piece of cardboard.
When Ben peeked out the back door, he saw Eli furiously adding glitter to his sign. “How’s it going?” Ben asked.
Eli held up the sign proudly. “Look! I made the lemons smile!”
Ben laughed. “Happy lemons? Well, that’ll definitely get people’s attention.”
By the time the lemonade was ready, Eli had finished his masterpiece. The bright letters on the sign read: “Fresh Lemonade – 50 Cents!” The corners sparkled with bits of glitter, and yes, each hand-drawn lemon had a big, cheerful grin.
The brothers set up their lemonade stand under the shade of the big oak tree in their front yard. On the small table, they placed the pitcher of lemonade, a stack of paper cups, and a bowl of ice. Eli propped the sign up proudly against the table.
“We’re officially open!” Ben announced, clapping his hands together.
For the first few minutes, nothing happened. Ben tapped his foot, squinting down the street. Eli leaned on the table, tossing ice cubes into his mouth and crunching loudly.
“Maybe we need to shout,” Eli said after a while.
“Nobody shouts about lemonade,” Ben said, but Eli wasn’t listening.
“Lemonade! Get your fresh lemonade! Best in the whole world!” Eli bellowed with all his might.
Ben groaned, but just then, Mrs. Stevens—their neighbor walking her dog—strolled by.
“Lemonade, huh?” she said, smiling.
“Yes!” Eli said eagerly. “And it’s the best you’ll ever taste!”
Ben quickly poured her a cup, careful not to spill. “That’ll be fifty cents,” he said with a polite smile.

Mrs. Stevens handed them two shiny quarters. She took a sip and nodded in approval. “Delicious! Good luck, boys.”
Ben and Eli grinned as she walked away. “First customer!” Ben said, giving Eli a high five.
More neighbors followed. Two kids riding scooters stopped for lemonade, then another neighbor bought a cup on her way to the park.
Ben poured the lemonade smoothly, making sure each cup had plenty of ice. Eli chatted happily with each customer, giving every person a big smile.
“Business is booming!” Eli said, shaking the jar where they kept the coins.
“Yeah, but we’re running low on lemonade,” Ben said, peering into the pitcher.
Eli’s eyes widened. “What if more people come? We can’t run out!”
Ben thought quickly. “I have an idea. Let’s grab some soda from the fridge. We’ll sell that too!”
Eli jumped up excitedly. “Yes! Lemonade and soda!”

They raced into the house, grabbed a bottle of soda, and brought it back to their stand just in time for two kids on bikes to arrive.
“Do you have lemonade?” one kid asked, catching his breath.
Ben poured the last drops of lemonade into a cup. “Yep! And we’ve got soda too.”
The kids cheered. Ben filled two cups with fizzy soda, and Eli handed them over with a flourish.
“We’re officially the first lemonade-and-soda stand,” Eli declared proudly.
As the afternoon went on, the brothers sold every last drop. When the sun began to sink behind the trees, they decided it was time to close up shop. They packed everything away and carried their table back inside.

Ben poured the coins out of the jar onto the table, and they counted together. “Six dollars and fifty cents!” Ben announced proudly.
“That’s enough for ice cream!” Eli said, his face lighting up with excitement.
They walked to the corner store, bought two big ice cream cones—chocolate for Eli and vanilla for Ben—and sat on the curb to enjoy their reward.
Eli grinned as he licked his cone. “We make a pretty good team.”
Ben nodded. “Yeah. I guess you’re not a bad business partner after all.”
Eli laughed. “Next time, we should add cookies.”
Ben rolled his eyes but couldn’t help smiling. “Alright. Cookies next time.”
As they sat together, watching the summer evening settle over the neighborhood, Ben realized that today hadn’t just been about lemonade or making money. It had been about working together, having fun, and making memories.
And who knew? Maybe next week, Ben and Eli’s Lemonade-and-Soda-and-Cookie Stand would be an even bigger hit.

The End.
