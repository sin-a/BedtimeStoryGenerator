The Garden of Midnight
Mag, Adv

In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, two best friends—Betty and Bruno—loved to stargaze. Every night, they sat beneath the sky, making up stories about constellations and distant worlds. But one night, the stars seemed dimmer, and the sky felt unusually quiet.
“Do you think the stars are hiding?” Betty asked, her voice a soft whisper.
Bruno shrugged. “Maybe they’re tired of shining for us.”
Betty smiled. “Then let’s find a place where something still shines, just for us.”
And so, hand in hand, they set off on an adventure—following the silver light of the moon that peeked through the clouds, hoping it would lead them to something magical.
They wandered past the sleepy cottages, through the meadow where fireflies blinked like tiny lanterns, and into the forest where shadows danced among the trees.
“Do you think there’s a secret waiting for us?” Bruno asked, his breath puffing in the chilly night air.
“I hope so,” Betty whispered. “A beautiful secret.”

The forest grew thicker the deeper they went, but the moonlight guided their steps. Just as they began to feel lost, they saw a faint glow peeking from behind a wall of ivy.
“Look!” Betty gasped.
Bruno reached out, and together they pulled the ivy aside, revealing a small wooden door—hidden, ancient, and carved with delicate patterns of leaves and flowers.
Without hesitation, they pushed it open, and what lay beyond took their breath away.

It was a garden—a garden of midnight, shimmering under the silver light of the moon. Flowers that only bloomed in the darkness swayed gently in the cool breeze. Some glowed faintly, as if holding stardust in their petals, while others sparkled with drops of dew that looked like tiny crystals.
Vines of luminescent ivy curled around glowing mushrooms, and a quiet stream flowed through the garden, its waters reflecting the night sky as if the stars had come to rest upon the earth. In the middle of it all stood a tree with leaves like glass, twinkling whenever the wind brushed past.
“It’s like a dream,” Bruno whispered, afraid that speaking too loudly might make it all disappear.
Betty wandered deeper into the garden, touching the glowing petals of a blue flower that pulsed with light, as if it had a heartbeat. “I didn’t know something so beautiful could exist, hidden where no one could see.”

Bruno crouched beside the stream, dipping his fingers into the cool water. As he did, tiny glowing fish darted around his hand like sparks in the night. “It feels like the stars came down just for us,” he said.
The two friends explored every corner of the garden, whispering their awe at each new discovery. They found a bed of soft moss that glittered under their footsteps, and a patch of moon-white roses that gave off the scent of dreams. Everything around them felt alive, as if the garden were breathing, waiting for someone to find it and appreciate its hidden beauty.
“I wonder why it’s hidden,” Betty said, looking around. “Something this beautiful shouldn’t stay a secret.”
Bruno smiled. “Maybe it’s a place for those who look beyond what they can see—for those who believe in secret worlds.”
Betty nodded. “Maybe it’s a gift—just for those who keep wondering.”

They lay down on the soft moss, gazing up at the glittering leaves of the tree above them. The night felt peaceful, and the stars seemed closer somehow, as if they were listening.
After what felt like hours—or maybe just minutes—they knew it was time to leave. They stood hand in hand, taking one last look at the beautiful garden.
“Do you think we’ll ever find it again?” Bruno asked as they stepped back through the wooden door.
“I think we’ll always carry it with us,” Betty said, smiling. “Some secrets are too beautiful to forget.”
And as the door swung shut behind them, the ivy curled back, hiding the entrance once more. But the garden of midnight stayed with them—in their hearts, in their dreams, and in the way they saw the world from that night forward.
Because once you discover a secret that beautiful, the world never looks quite the same again.

The End.
