The Post Office at the Edge of the World
Ani

At the very end of the forest, where the land gently touched the sea, there stood a tiny post office. It wasn’t grand or busy—just a small cottage with crooked shutters and a bell that jingled whenever the door opened. But this post office was special because it handled letters that no one else could deliver—letters addressed to the strangest places, written by the most unexpected senders.
Running the post office was Freddy, a blackbird with a love of mail. He wore a tiny blue cap and carried a leather satchel slung across his chest. Freddy wasn’t just any postmaster; he could deliver letters to places no map could find—a hidden cave beneath the ocean, a cloud drifting above the mountains, or even the house of the North Wind.
Freddy loved his job, and every morning, he’d sort through his pile of mail with excitement, eager to see where the letters would take him.

One misty morning, Freddy found an unusual letter waiting in his post bag. It was written on a leaf, folded neatly into an envelope, with tiny raindrops sealed inside. The address read:
“To the Moon, Somewhere in the Sky.”
Freddy tilted his head, puzzled. “The moon? I’ve never delivered a letter to the moon before.”
He thought about the night sky and how far away the moon seemed. But Freddy was a dedicated postmaster, and no letter had ever gone undelivered. With a cheerful chirp, he packed the letter into his satchel, spread his wings, and took off toward the sky.

Freddy flew over hills and valleys, rivers and towns. He soared higher and higher, past drifting clouds and flocks of geese heading south. But the farther he flew, the smaller the world beneath him seemed, and the bigger the sky became.
At last, Freddy reached the tops of the clouds, where the sky felt endless. He paused, hovering in the chilly air, staring up at the silver moon hanging in the distance. It glowed softly, cool and quiet, far beyond his reach.
Freddy’s wings drooped. “How do you deliver a letter to the moon if you can’t fly that high?” he wondered aloud.
Just then, the North Wind swirled by, ruffling Freddy’s feathers. “Looking for the moon, little bird?” the wind whistled playfully.
“Yes,” Freddy replied, clutching the letter close. “I have a delivery to make.”
The North Wind chuckled. “You’re quite far from the moon, I’m afraid. But I can carry you as close as I can. Hop aboard!”
Freddy tucked the letter safely into his satchel and leapt onto the breeze. The North Wind howled with laughter, swirling Freddy upward in great loops and gusts, carrying him higher than he had ever flown before.

When the North Wind slowed, Freddy found himself floating just beneath the glowing moon. It was closer now, but still distant, as if wrapped in soft fog. Freddy took a deep breath and called out:
“Hello, Moon! I have a letter for you!”
The moon didn’t answer, but its glow brightened, as if it had heard Freddy’s call.
Freddy tried again. “Someone sent you a letter! I flew all this way to bring it to you.”
This time, the moon gave the softest hum, like a lullaby heard on a breeze. Freddy took the letter from his satchel and held it up.
“I don’t know what it says,” Freddy added, “but I think it’s very important.”
The moon gave a gentle shimmer, as if smiling. A soft beam of light reached out, wrapping around the letter like an invisible hand. The leaf-envelope glimmered for a moment, then slowly unfolded. As Freddy watched, the raindrops inside the letter floated up and burst into tiny stars, scattering across the night sky.
Freddy’s heart swelled with pride. He had done it—he had delivered the letter, even though the journey seemed impossible at first.
“Thank you,” the moon’s hum seemed to whisper, though no words were spoken aloud.
Freddy gave a cheerful chirp. “You’re welcome!”

The North Wind returned with a playful gust, carrying Freddy back down to the world below. Freddy held on tight, his heart light and happy as the wind whooshed him through clouds and over mountains.
When he finally landed outside the little post office, the morning sun was just beginning to rise. Freddy shook out his feathers, straightened his blue cap, and stepped inside, ready to sort the next batch of letters.
And from that day on, whenever Freddy looked up at the night sky, he could see the tiny stars twinkling—those same little raindrop-stars from the letter to the moon. And he knew that no letter was ever too small or too far away to deliver, as long as you tried your best.

The End.
